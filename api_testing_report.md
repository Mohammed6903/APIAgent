# API Testing Report - 2025-06-09 19:55:35

### Executive Summary

This report summarizes the automated testing performed on the API located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, using the OpenAPI documentation provided at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json`. The testing focused on validating status codes and strictly enforcing data type compliance against the documented schemas for all accessible endpoints.

A total of **16** endpoints were identified from the OpenAPI documentation. **15** endpoints were attempted for testing. One endpoint (`/api/v1/project/process_upload/` POST) could not be fully tested due to limitations in sending `multipart/form-data` with a binary file using the available tools, resulting in a validation error (422).

The testing revealed a significant discrepancy between the documented response schemas and the actual API responses for successful operations (status code 200). For almost all endpoints returning a 200 status, the OpenAPI documentation specified an empty object `{}` as the response schema, while the API returned complex JSON objects or arrays. This indicates that the documentation is outdated or inaccurate regarding the structure of successful responses, preventing strict data type validation from passing even when the API returned a successful status code and valid JSON content.

Additionally, specific endpoint failures were observed:
- A GET request to `/api/v1/file/get_file/{file_name}` with a placeholder name returned a 404 Not Found error.
- A POST request to `/api/v1/email/send-email/individual` resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error.
- The POST request to `/api/v1/project/process_upload/` failed with a 422 Validation Error due to an inability to provide the required file upload payload.

Overall, while most endpoints returned a 200 status code when expected (indicating functional success), the widespread data type mismatches highlight critical issues with the accuracy of the API documentation. The observed status code errors on specific endpoints also warrant further investigation.

### Data Type Compliance Issues

A widespread issue observed across multiple endpoints is the discrepancy between the documented response schema for successful (200) responses and the actual data structure returned by the API. The OpenAPI documentation consistently specifies an empty object `{}` for the 200 response schema for many endpoints that, in practice, return non-empty JSON objects or arrays with detailed properties. This prevents accurate data type validation against the documentation and indicates a significant need for documentation updates to reflect the true structure of the API responses.

Affected endpoints include:
- `/api/v1/analytics/generate-chart-data` (GET)
- `/api/v1/chat/get_chat_history` (GET)
- `/api/v1/personnel/selected-personnel` (GET)
- `/api/v1/resume/resume-analysis-results` (GET)
- `/api/v1/bias/bias-analysis` (POST)
- `/api/v1/chat/update_chat_history` (POST)
- `/api/v1/email/send-email/bulk` (POST)
- `/api/v1/interview/analyze_interview` (POST)
- `/api/v1/personnel/selected-personnel/upload` (POST)
- `/api/v1/project/process_url_or_path` (POST)
- `/api/v1/project/analyze_project/` (POST)
- `/api/v1/resume/rank-resumes` (POST)

### Performance Metrics

Performance metrics were not collected as part of this testing run.

### Recommendations for Improvements

Based on the testing results, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Update OpenAPI Documentation:** Urgently update the OpenAPI specification to accurately reflect the actual response schemas for all endpoints, especially for successful (200) responses. Define the correct data types, structures, and properties for all fields returned by the API.
2.  **Investigate and Fix Server Errors:** Investigate the root cause of the 500 Internal Server Error observed on the `/api/v1/email/send-email/individual` POST endpoint and implement a fix.
3.  **Clarify GET Endpoint Behavior:** Clarify the expected behavior and documentation for the `/api/v1/file/get_file/{file_name}` GET endpoint. If the 404 is expected for non-existent files, this should be clearly documented along with the schema for a successful response when the file exists.
4.  **Address File Upload Endpoint:** Provide clear documentation and potentially alternative methods for handling file uploads if `multipart/form-data` is the only method and requires specific handling or payload structures.
5.  **Implement Robust Input Validation:** Ensure robust input validation is in place for all endpoints, returning appropriate 4xx status codes (like 422) with informative error messages when validation fails.

This concludes the API testing report based on the provided documentation and accessible endpoints.
