# API Testing Report

This report summarizes the results of testing the API endpoints at `http://localhost:5000` based on the documentation in `doc.json`.

## Summary

All defined API endpoints, excluding the WEBSOCKET endpoints which are not testable with the available tools, have been successfully tested. The API generally behaves as expected based on the provided documentation. Some endpoints lack detailed response specifications in the documentation, but returned successful status codes.

## Endpoints Tested

*   `/resume-analysis-results` (GET): Success
*   `/rank-resumes` (POST): Success
*   `/bias-analysis` (POST): Success
*   `/selected-personnel/upload` (POST): Success
*   `/send-email/individual` (POST): Success
*   `/send-email/bulk` (POST): Success
*   `/process_url_or_path` (POST): Success
*   `/analyze_project/` (POST): Success
*   `/update_chat_history` (POST): Success

## Recommendations

*   The `doc.json` file should be updated to include expected responses for all endpoints, especially `/process_url_or_path`, `/analyze_project/`, and `/update_chat_history`, to allow for more comprehensive testing.
*   Consider adding more robust error handling and logging to aid in debugging and issue resolution.
*   Implement testing for WEBSOCKET endpoints.
